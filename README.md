Introduction
DevTreks is a multitier ASP.NET Core 1 database 
application. The web project, DevTreks, uses an 
MVC pattern. The data layer, DevTreks.Data, uses 
an EF Core 1 data repository pattern. EF data models 
are stored in the DevTreks.Models project. ASPNET 
Identity models are stored in the DevTreks web 
Project’s Data folder. Localization strings are stored in 
the DevTreks.Exceptions and DevTreks.Resources 
projects. The DevTreks.Extensions folder holds 
projects that use a Managed Extensibility Framework 
pattern. Each project holds a separate group of 
calculators and analyzers.

What's New in Version 2.0.2
1.	CTAs (Conservation Technology Assessments): R, Python, Statistical Virtual Machine, and AML: The Technology Assessment 01 tutorial is being upgraded to explain the changes being made for Version 2.0.2, including the use of Anaconda 4 with Python 3.5.2, Microsoft R Open and Intel Math Kernel with R 3.3.0, Statistical Virtual Machines with various statistical packages, and Azure Machine Learning (AML) web services. 
2.	DevTreks WebApi: A new ASP.NET Core 1 WebApi app exposes a REST interface that accepts POST http commands that contain a JSON string in the request’s body (i.e. http://locahost:5000/api/statscript). The object’s properties include a data URL and a statistical script URL. The host runs the statistical script against the data and returns the JSON string that holds the statistical results.
